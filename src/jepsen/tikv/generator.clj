  "Generates operations for a test. Generators are composable, stateful objects
    which emit operations for processes until they are exhausted, at which point
    they return nil. Generators may sleep when generating operations, to delay
    the rate at which the test proceeds
  
    Generators do *not* have to emit a :process for their operations; test
    workers will take care of that.
  
    Every object may act as a generator, and constantly yields itself.
